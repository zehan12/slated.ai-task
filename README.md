# Project - 3 hours. ( Live Coding Round )
### Build a one page with following specs:

- ### Build a web page that lists all the documents, with a search bar that can search within the text inside the documents. Clicking the links should open a page with the transcript with the segment searched highlighted. Rank the search results. 

- ### Please build the front end web page first. 


### We will provide 

-  Google drive with all the transcript files 

-  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/167nvaFIm_0GW9fW6JGGjWO6L5nHd1OxN?usp=drive_link


### Requirements

- Use  NextJS (react/nodejs)

- Code with live screen share

- Use vector search (ideally) or semantic search (at a minimum): eg: searching for "fast growth" should show "accelerated traction" as a result. 


### Evaluation

- Best in class: 

    - Great design - easy to read, results apparent in a glance, allows user to click the most relevant link immediately 

    - Vector or Semantic search - searching for “revenue growth” shows “topline growth”,”revenue growth”,”sales upside”, etc

    - Smart sort options - sort by date, most relevant, etc

    - Smart filter options - filter by type of transcript
